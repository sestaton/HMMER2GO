Revision history for HMMER2GO

Version	Date	Location
0.18.1	01/09/2022	Saskatoon, SK

Bug fixes:
- Drop old FTP location of mapping files and GO ontology in favor of new location (fixes #25).
- Adjust test output for creating custom HMM database based on term search (update expected model number for the search).

New features:
- Use HTTP GET for fetching mapping and ontology files instead of FTP.

0.18.0	01/30/2021	Saskatoon, SK

Bug fixes:
- Keep the original sequence IDs in the output from 'hmmer2go getorf' without the ORF number and location
  appended to the ID. Fixes issue #23.
- Omit obsolete terms from GO when writing GAF file with 'hmmer2go map2gaf' command.
- Drop usage of 'each %hash' syntax because 'keys %hash' is safer.

New features:
- Add method to get the taxon ID from NCBI based on the input species name, rather than hard coding an ID.
- For the 'hmmer2go map2gaf' command, add GAF header describing the date of the analysis, HMMER2GO version,
  and the GO database version used to generate the data.
- Get GO definitions from latest full GO database (i.e., go.obo) instead of the older GO alt-ids file that was being
  used for the term mapping.
  
0.17.9	04/19/2019	Vancouver, BC

  Suggestion on github issue #16.
- Add Docker image usage instructions and expand install methods.

0.17.8	05/25/2018	Vancouver, BC

  a method and not handling the change in the code.

0.17.7	03/29/2018	Vancouver, BC

- Add method to transform identifiers that may cause problems for EMBOSS. Added tests for the expected
  results of the method.

0.17.6	01/09/2018	Vancouver, BC

- Add option to only report one ORF with the 'getorf' command when multiple ORFs have the same max
  length.
- Remove use of 'each' on hash in 'getorf' command in favor of the more stable 'keys' function.

0.17.5	10/04/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Fix bug with newlines being inserted into sequences when printing ORFs in the same frame.

0.17.4	05/02/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Fix regex for getting database number with 'pfamsearch' command (resolves #11).
- Use lexical file handles everywhere.
- Test that we can open file handles everywhere.

0.17.3	09/17/2016	Vancouver, BC

- Add --outfile flag to 'run' command to make the usage a bit easier to understand
  since the output is required by other commands.

0.17.2	03/02/2016	Vancouver, BC

- Fix bug in output of wrong type of ORF (previously only generating translated ORFs).
- Fix syntax error in getorf tests that was keeping all the input files from being tested.
- Add warning for getorf command for cases where multiple ORFs have the max length.

0.17.1	01/21/2016	Vancouver, BC

- Fix bug in expected Pfam mappings based on new entries.

0.17	11/02/2015	Vancouver, BC

- Remove use of spawning a new shell for executing programs.
- Add faster and more portable method for searching path for 
  required programs.

0.16 	8/07/2015	Vancouver, BC

- Remove use of environment variables to build and install package.

0.15	6/10/2015	Vancouver, BC

  (which is incompatible with the latest models).

0.13	4/28/2015	Vancouver, BC

- Remove readfq library and fall back to supporting only FASTA format.
  This is to fix issues with some sequence files generating warnings
  during parsing (fixed now).

0.12	3/25/2015	Vancouver, BC

- Add compressed file support in the 'run' and 'getorf' command
  classes.
- Bugfixes for the latest GO mappings in the tests for the 'mapterms'
  command, and a minor fix in testing the output of the main command.

0.11	1/27/2015	Vancouver, BC

- Bugfix for the use of split in the mapterms command class.
  This fixes #4 on Github.

0.10	11/05/2014	Vancouver, BC

  mapping file.

0.09	10/29/2014	Vancouver, BC

  has no dependencies.
- Fix dependencies listed in cpanfile and Makefile.PL.

0.08	10/13/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Modify method for formatting HMM database to use core
  module (use 'File::Find' instead of 'File::Find::Rule'. The
  latter module is very good, it's just not a core module).

0.07	10/11/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Add method (and tests) for formatting custom HMM database for HMMER.
- Add better error handling and reporting when running HMMER.
- Add tests for running HMMER on custom DB created with 'pfamsearch'
  command.

- Add command for search Pfam for terms (called 'pfamsearch'),
  and create a database of HMMs from the search results, optionally.
- Add method to 'mapterms' class to get pfam to GO mapping file 
  automatically, thus avoiding the requirement for a user-supplied
  file.
- Change name of 'search' command to 'run' and add --program
  option to allow add more domin-finding methods in the future.

0.05	08/22/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Lower Perl version requirements to 5.10 (was 5.12).
- Expanded tests to cover newer (i.e., 5.20) and older (i.e,
  5.10) Perls.

0.04	08/20/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Fixed bug with not calculating the number of GO terms
  correctly (was underrepresenting the actual count).
- Fixed bug with GO description being truncated in the output.
- Removed use of UTF-8 characters for generating hash keys.
  - This resulted in speed improvements, and will allow the 
    Perl version requirement to be lowered in a future release.
- Add tests to make sure the correct results are reported when
  mapping GO terms, instead of just testing that there is 
  output.

0.03	08/01/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Add option to find all ORFs, not just the longest.
- Bug fixes to POD in several modules.

- Add short option for getting documentation for all
  commands.

0.01    06/09/2014	Athens, GA
